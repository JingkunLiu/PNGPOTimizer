PNGPOTimizer is a commandline tool to convert images to PNG with dimensions that are POT (powers of two).
It is intended to be used in Game development for the iPhone so some assumptions are made with that intention in mind.
This runs from Terminal on the Mac with Snow Leopard.
This skips files with the following names:
	iTunesArtwork
	Default.png
	Icon.png
	Icon@2x.png
	Icon-Small.png
	Icon-Small@2x.png
	Icon-Small-50.png
	Icon-72.png
It runs on a list of files passed, or recursively through a directory.
It outputs .pvz (PVR file wrapped in a custom CCZ (zlib compressed) custom container format which is supported natively by cocos2d)
